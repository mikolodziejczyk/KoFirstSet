    <h1>Iterable</h1>
    <pre>
        1. Iterable&lt;T&gt; interface
            - what it defines, couterpart of which interface in .NET
            - what are symbols?
          2. Iterator&lt;T&gt; / iterator protocol
            - what it defines (overview), couterpart of which interface in .NET
            - what is the internal procedure of iteration, the IteratorResult&lt;T&gt; interface, when starts and when ends
            - when new iteration starts
          3. What can you iterate: Iterable&lt;T&gt; or Iterator&lt;T&gt;?
          4. What are required config settings for ts.
             - downlevelIteration - what it is?
             - lib: "es2015.collection" vs "es2015.iterable"
          5. Iteration
             - iterate and log every member of the set, map and map values.
          6. Converting an iterable to array 
             - convert the set to array, log
             - convert the map keys to array, log
          7. Using the spread operator
             - create an array with "Sue", then all set members and "Dick"
             - create an array with all the map values and "Patti" appended
          
          8. Plain generator
             - create a generator method, getSomeNames, that takes a prefix (a string) and returns a few names, each 
          prefixed
             - explicitly specify the iterated type
             - iterate the results and log them
          9. Breaking iteration
             - when inside for .. of loop you break after e.g. the second result, what happens: which code in the 
          generator method is executed? 
             - What if the yield statement was inside try .. finally block? What with statements after finally {} in 
          this case?
          10. Throwing exception during iteration
             - what happens when you throw an exeception inside a generator method?
               - what if this was wrapped in try .. catch block inside the generator?
               - what if not? how try .. catch block in the consuming code affect this?
             - what happens when you throw an exeception during iteration but in the consuming code rather that in the 
          generator method?
             - injecting an exception into the generator from the consuming code - overview
          
          11. Generator method type
             - in the constructor create a local variable with a generator method. The method should yield values from 
          0 to 10 in the loop.
             - specify the return type explicitly
             - consume the result with the spread operator and log the result
          
          12. Creating iterable object
             - make the whole MyApp class iterable so that you can consume it as an iterable, in the method return a 
          few names
             - consume it with Array.from
          
          13. Returning iteration results from another method
            - in the method from the previous point to the existing results add results from getSomeNames, iterated 
          (not via a collection).
